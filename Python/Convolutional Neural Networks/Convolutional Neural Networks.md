# Convolutional Neural Network Basics :

## Advantages of Fully connected Neural Networks :

* By **Universal Approximation Theorem** DNN are the the most powerfull function approximators
* These can be trained using Back propogation

## Disadvantages of FFN :

* Due to huge number of parameters DNN are prone to ovrfitting
* DNN suffers from gradient vanishing issue

## Intuition behind CNN :

To create complex DNNs but withh lesser parameters and thus less prone to overfitting

* CNN are sparsely connected networks (less parameters, less complexity thus less prone to overfitting)
* CNN uses weight sharing , thus using more kernels we can improve the complexity of model
